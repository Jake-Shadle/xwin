Displays a summary of the packages that would be downloaded.

Note that this is not a full list as the SDK uses MSI files for many packages,
so they would need to be downloaded and inspected to determine which CAB files
must also be downloaded to get the content needed.

Usage: list

Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
