Fixes the packages to prune unneeded files and adds symlinks to address file
casing issues and then spalts the final artifacts into directories

Usage: splat [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --include-debug-libs
          The MSVCRT includes (non-redistributable) debug versions of the
          various libs that are generally uninteresting to keep for most usage

      --include-debug-symbols
          The MSVCRT includes PDB (debug symbols) files for several of the
          libraries that are generally uninteresting to keep for most usage

      --disable-symlinks
          By default, symlinks are added to both the CRT and WindowsSDK to
          address casing issues in general usage. For example, if you are
          compiling C/C++ code that does `#include <windows.h>`, it will break
          on a case-sensitive file system, as the actual path in the WindowsSDK
          is `Windows.h`. This also applies even if the C/C++ you are compiling
          uses correct casing for all CRT/SDK includes, as the internal headers
          also use incorrect casing in most cases

      --preserve-ms-arch-notation
          By default, we convert the MS specific `x64`, `arm`, and `arm64`
          target architectures to the more canonical `x86_64`, `aarch`, and
          `aarch64` of LLVM etc when creating directories/names. Passing this
          flag will preserve the MS names for those targets

      --output <OUTPUT>
          The root output directory. Defaults to `./.xwin-cache/splat` if not
          specified

      --copy
          Copies files from the unpack directory to the splat directory instead
          of moving them, which preserves the original unpack directories but
          increases overall time and disk usage

  -h, --help
          Print help

  -V, --version
          Print version
